    <h1>Ingredient</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>lollipop sticks</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30
            seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Pour batter into
            the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool
            cake completely, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crumble cake into a large bowl and mix in cream cheese. Roll cake mixture into about 40 to 50 quarter-size
            balls. Insert a lollipop stick into each cake ball and arrange on a baking sheet; refrigerate until chilled,
            at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each
            melting, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Dip each cake ball into melted chocolate until coated. Arrange cake pops on a baking sheet to dry.</li>
    </ol>
